<p>Hi, my name is Michael Minshew and I like to fix things. I originally started out in the restaurant industry leading front end teams
    and managing operations, creating a welcoming and fun environment for both customers and team members.
</p>

<p>After working in restaurant industry I had the opportunity to move to my now favorite city in Texas, Austin. I started out a short term job in a call center which turned into
an incredible 5 year adventure. I moved from working with MLB.com to the sadly now bankrupt Golfsmith International. What I thought would be a short stint in customer service turned into an 8 year adventure in leadership
operations and project management. I worked in customer service and after showing tremendous patience and an unusually thick skin during an Oracle overhaul I was moved to a team lead position </p>

<p>We made it through the change over and after a few months Golfsmith merged with Golf Town a Canadian golf retailer and I stepped into an operations role with the Golf Town fulfillment and transitions team. After learning the ends an outs of the Canadian systems and operations
I was promoted to a Web Support Supervisor role, which was just a fancy way to say that I managed our email, click to chat, Canada customer service team and any call center operations. Shortly after being promoted the company underwent a restructuring and suddenly the manager of the call center
was no longer with the company.</p>

<p>Partnering with my peers we revamped our metrics and reporting, installed and implemented a workforce solution to manage schedules. On the side I helped build out the ability to take phone orders for the Canada support team, something that wasn't possible before. I also had built out and written most of the processes from recieving orders to customer receipt and almost everything in between. During this time I went from managing 5 people and 1 team lead to about 22 people and 2 team leads  spanning everything from USA customer service, general operations, Canada sales and service and our entire email and chat team.</p>

<p>After working with the service team as a Supervisor for about a year and a half we had settled down the bulk of the operational issues the call center had developed over the 15 years it had been in existence. My team leads had been trained and were managing the majority of the day to day operations of the call center. I had an opportunity to move to the Golfsmith Loss Prevention department helping manage the Golf Town Ecommerce side of that department, I'd written most of the rules and processes for our current loss prevention implementation it seemed like a solid fit. I worked in the loss prevention team for about 6 months helping rewrite and rebuild the Canada fraud prevention ruleset and how the system processed bad orders.</p>

<p>After working loss prevention for 6 months I moved to the Ecommerce operations team helping manage both the golfsmith website (A top 200 Ecommerce website) and the Golf Town ecommerce website. Here I grew in project management, SEO processes, Ecommerce best practices, Marketing and overall ecommerce operations. This was when I finally realized my passion. As much as I enjoyed service related roles my real niche and passion was solving problems. Whether it was managing a multi-department impementations to solve problems with a process or system or just debugging a browser issue on the website. I had found what made me tick, which was namely finding out how other things ticked and then fixing any problems.</p>

<p>After over a year in ecommerce Golfsmith filed for bankrupty and we started the shutdown and settling of the company. Being a SME for most of the Golf Town operations and systems I was able to stay till the very end of the shutdown and conversion. </p>

<p>In June of 2017 knowing that my time with Golfsmith International was ending I was approached by a friend to start an SEO and Ecommerce Consulting business, after some basework Pecan Street Web Solutions LLC was born. I had realized at this point that solving problems was my passion and decided to switch from general operations and project management to ecommerce and website development.
  Now between learning full stack development, Consulting with Pecan Street Web Solutions and freelancing I've found my place in the world.
  I get to create a website or a business owners ideas out of nothing and make something amazing. I get to spend my day figuring out everything from database issues, CRM opportunities and javascript errors to learning a new framework or mapping out a marketing strategy for clients </p>
